# üé® Create Item Form Redesign

## Overview
The Create Item form has been completely redesigned for clarity, ease of use, and confidence. The new design follows a clear step-by-step approach that guides you naturally through the creation process.

## ‚ú® Key Improvements

### 1. **Clear Step-by-Step Flow**
Instead of overwhelming sections, the form now uses numbered steps:
- **Step 1**: Choose Type (Reminder or Event)
- **Step 2**: What's it about? (Title & Description)
- **Step 3**: When? (Date & Time details)
- **Step 4**: How important? (Priority & Categories)
- **Step 5**: Break it down (Subtasks - Reminders only)
- **Step 6**: Additional settings (Status & Visibility)

### 2. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Each step has a **numbered blue circle** making progression obvious
- Clear section headings with contextual questions
- Consistent spacing and padding throughout
- Maximum width of 800px to avoid overwhelming wide screens

### 3. **Simplified Design Elements**
- **Removed**: Heavy gradients, excessive shadows, glass effects, emoji overload
- **Added**: Clean borders, subtle hover states, clear focus indicators
- **Result**: Professional, easy-to-scan interface

### 4. **Context-Aware Labels**
Labels now ask questions based on context:
- "When is it due?" for reminders
- "When does it happen?" for events
- "What's it about?" instead of generic "Details"
- "How important is it?" instead of "Priority Level"
