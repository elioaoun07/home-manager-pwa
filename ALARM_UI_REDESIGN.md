# Alarm Picker UI Redesign

## Overview
Redesigned the AlarmPicker component to better match the app's glassmorphic design ecosystem and reduce visual clutter.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Glassmorphic Design**
- Added `backdrop-blur-sm` effects throughout
- Implemented gradient backgrounds (`from-blue-50/80 to-indigo-50/80`)
- Softer, translucent borders with opacity (`border-blue-200/50`)
- Consistent with app's existing design language

### 2. **More Compact Layout**
- Alarm badges now use flex-wrap in a horizontal layout instead of vertical cards
- Reduced label verbosity: "5 minutes before" ‚Üí "5m before"
- Smaller icons (3.5 instead of 4)
- Quick presets reduced from 4 to 3 most essential options
- Emoji icons for notification channels (üì± üìß üí¨)

### 3. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**
- Alarms displayed first (most important info)
- Add button positioned below alarms (clearer flow)
- Quick preset icons added (‚ö° ‚úì ‚≠ê) for faster recognition
- Delete buttons hidden until hover (reduced clutter)

### 4. **Enhanced UX**
- 3-column grid for alarm time options (more compact)
- Segmented control for Relative/Exact Time toggle
- Smoother transitions and hover effects
- Better dark mode support throughout

### 5. **Preserved Functionality**
- All original features intact
- Same alarm types (relative & absolute)
- Same notification channels
- Same preset options

## Visual Changes

### Before
- Large vertical card layout for each alarm

- Plain card backgrounds

### After
- Compact horizontal badge layout
- Abbreviated labels ("5m before")
- Emoji indicators for channels
- Hover-only delete buttons
- Gradient glassmorphic backgrounds
- Better spacing and breathing room
