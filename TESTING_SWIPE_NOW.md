## 🎯 What You Should See

### Visual Feedback During Swipe:

**Dragging Right:**
\`\`\`
0px → 50px → 100px (threshold)
Clear → Light Green → Full Green + Checkmark ✓
\`\`\`

**Dragging Left:**
\`\`\`
0px → -50px → -100px (threshold)
Clear → Light Blue → Full Blue + Edit Icon 📝
\`\`\`

### After Release:

**Short Swipe (< 100px):**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any gradient when I swipe"
- Make sure you're in mobile device mode (F12 → toggle device)
- Try dragging further (at least 100px)
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

### "Swipe doesn't trigger anything"
- Swipe horizontally, not diagonally
- Make sure you drag past the 100px threshold
- Try swiping faster

### "Cards just move but don't do anything"
- This is correct for short swipes!
- Drag further (past 100px) to trigger actions
- Look for the gradient color change

### "Page scrolls when I try to swipe"
- This is normal for vertical scrolling
- Swipe more horizontally (←→) not vertically (↕)

### "Nothing happens at all"
- Check that you're on the Notes view
- Make sure you have some notes created
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R)

## 🎨 Expected Behavior

### ✅ Correct:
- Horizontal swipe shows gradient background
- Short swipes snap back smoothly
- Full swipes trigger actions
- Vertical scrolling still works
- Tap opens view mode

### ❌ Incorrect:
- No visual feedback during drag
- Swipes don't register at all
- Page crashes or freezes
- Console shows errors

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Desktop Testing**: Use mouse to drag cards left/right
