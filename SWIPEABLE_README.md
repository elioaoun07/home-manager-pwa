## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Swipe doesn't work"
→ Enable touch simulation in DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+M)  
→ Swipe horizontally, not diagonally

### "Actions menu won't open"
→ Swipe past -100px threshold (swipe further left)  
→ Check that handlers are passed to component

### "Page scrolls during swipe"
→ This is normal! Vertical scroll is preserved  
→ Swipe horizontally to trigger actions

### "TypeScript errors"
→ Verify all prop types match `ItemWithDetails`  
→ Check that handlers have correct signatures
