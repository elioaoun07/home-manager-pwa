#Someday     → Future projects, aspirations
#Reference   → Info you want to keep
#Wishlist    → Things you want
```

### 2. Priority Levels for Notes
- **🔥 Urgent**: Important notes you need soon (will convert to reminder)
- **🔥 High**: Things to do this week (likely to become reminders)
- **➖ Normal**: Standard notes
- **⬇️ Low**: Nice-to-have, reference info

### 3. Quick Capture Workflow

(2 seconds or less!)
```

### 4. Weekly Review
Every week:
1. Go through your Notes
2. Ask: "Does this need a deadline?"
3. If yes: Convert to Reminder
4. If no: Keep as Note or archive

### 5. Batch Conversion
When you're ready to plan:
1. Open Notes view
2. Review all notes
3. Convert action items to Reminders
4. Keep reference info as Notes
