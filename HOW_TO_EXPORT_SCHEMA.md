# How to Export Your Supabase Schema

Since you already have a schema built in Supabase, here are **3 methods** to export it:

---

## ‚úÖ Method 1: Use Supabase Dashboard (EASIEST)

### Steps:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kqqdbauojjeatvftxluz

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

3. **Run the schema export queries**
   - Open the file: `GET_SCHEMA_QUERIES.sql`
   - Copy and run each section separately
   - Save the results

4. **Alternative: Use Schema Visualizer**
   - Go to "Database" ‚Üí "Schema Visualizer"
   - This shows a visual representation
   - You can export from there

---

## ‚úÖ Method 2: Use Supabase CLI with Docker (COMPLETE)

### Requirements:
- Install Docker Desktop
- Start Docker

### Steps:

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in (you already are)
npx supabase link

# Dump the complete schema
npx supabase db dump --linked -f complete_schema.sql

# This creates a complete PostgreSQL dump including:
# - All tables
# - All constraints
# - All indexes
# - All triggers
# - All RLS policies
# - All functions
```

**This is the MOST COMPLETE method** but requires Docker.

---

## ‚úÖ Method 3: Use pg_dump Directly (ADVANCED)

### Requirements:
- PostgreSQL client installed
- Database connection string

### Steps:

1. **Get your database connection string**
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Database
   - Copy the connection string (use the direct connection, not pooler)

2. **Run pg_dump**
   ```bash
   pg_dump "your-connection-string-here" \
     --schema=public \
     --no-owner \
     --no-privileges \
     -f supabase_schema.sql
   ```

---

## üìã What I've Created For You

### Files in your project:

1. **`GET_SCHEMA_QUERIES.sql`** ‚Üê **USE THIS!**
   - SQL queries to run in Supabase Dashboard
   - Each query gets a different part of the schema
   - Run in SQL Editor and save results

2. **`export-real-schema.mjs`**
   - Node.js script (limited without service role key)
   - Only shows table structure from data

3. **`supabase_real_schema.sql`**
   - Partial export (tables are empty, couldn't infer structure)

---

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### **BEST: Method 2 (If you have Docker)**

```bash
# Install Docker Desktop from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
# Start Docker
# Then run:
npx supabase db dump --linked -f complete_schema.sql
```

This gives you a **complete, executable SQL file** with everything.

### **EASIEST: Method 1 (No Docker needed)**

1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kqqdbauojjeatvftxluz/sql
2. Run the queries from `GET_SCHEMA_QUERIES.sql`
3. Copy/paste the results into a file
4. Done!

## üîç Quick Export (Without Docker)

If you just want to see the current state:

```bash
# Run this script I created
node export-real-schema.mjs
```

This will show you:
- Table names
- Row counts
- Basic structure (if tables have data)

But it won't give you the complete CREATE statements without Docker or manual queries.

---

## üìä What You'll Get

A complete schema export includes:

‚úÖ CREATE TABLE statements  
‚úÖ Column definitions with types  
‚úÖ PRIMARY KEY constraints  
‚úÖ FOREIGN KEY constraints with CASCADE rules  
‚úÖ UNIQUE constraints  
‚úÖ CHECK constraints  
‚úÖ INDEX definitions  
‚úÖ TRIGGER definitions  
‚úÖ FUNCTION definitions  
‚úÖ ROW LEVEL SECURITY policies  
‚úÖ ALTER TABLE statements  

---

## üí° My Recommendation

**Run this now:**

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
# Copy the contents of GET_SCHEMA_QUERIES.sql
# Run each section and save the results
```

OR

**If you can install Docker:**

```bash
# Install Docker Desktop
# Start Docker
# Run:
npx supabase db dump --linked -f complete_schema.sql
```

The second option is easier but requires Docker. The first option works immediately but requires manual copy/paste.
