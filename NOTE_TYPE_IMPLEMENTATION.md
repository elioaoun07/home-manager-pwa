# Note Type Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new **Note** item type alongside the existing **Reminder** and **Event** types. Notes are quick, date-free items that can be easily converted to Reminders when needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
- Updated `ItemType` to include `"note"`: `export type ItemType = "reminder" | "event" | "note";`

### 2. Database Schema
Created two migrations:
- **`20251101120000_add_note_type.sql`**: Adds 'note' to the `item_type_enum`
- **`20251101120001_convert_reminders_to_notes.sql`**: Converts existing reminders without due dates to notes

### 3. Create/Edit Form (`src/components/EditFormNew.tsx`)
- Added Note type selection with **orange gradient** styling (from-amber-500 to-orange-500)
- Added StickyNote icon for Note type
- **Hidden date/time fields** when Note type is selected (Step 3 "When is it due?" is hidden)
- Shows only: Title, Description, Priority, and Categories for Notes
- Step numbers auto-adjust: Step 3 for Notes (Priority), Step 4 for Reminders/Events
- Status defaults to "pending" for Notes (not visible in UI)
- Form header updates: "Create a quick note" for Notes

### 4. Notes View (`src/components/NotesView.tsx`)
- Updated filter to show items with `type === "note"` instead of `type === "reminder" && !due_at`
- Cleaner, more accurate filtering

### 5. View Details (`src/components/ViewDetails.tsx`)
- Added StickyNote icon for Note type
- **New "When is it due?" section** for Notes:
  - Orange gradient card with CalendarPlus icon
  - Button to convert Note → Reminder by opening edit form
  - User can then change type to Reminder and set due date

### 6. Item Card (`src/components/ItemCard.tsx`)
- Added StickyNote icon import
- Updated config to handle Note type with orange styling:
  - Icon: StickyNote
  - Color: text-orange-600
  - Background: bg-orange-50

### 7. Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Updated note counting logic: `type === "note"` instead of checking for reminders without due dates

## User Experience Flow

### Creating a Note
1. Open create form
2. Select **Note** type (orange gradient button)
3. Fill in:
   - Title (required)
   - Description (optional)
   - Priority (low/normal/high/urgent)
   - Categories (optional)
4. No date/time fields shown
5. Status automatically set to "pending"
6. Save

### Converting Note to Reminder
1. Click on a Note in the Notes view
2. View Details drawer opens
3. See **"When is it due?"** button in orange card
4. Click the button
5. Edit form opens with the Note
6. Change type from "Note" to "Reminder"
7. Step 3 "When is it due?" now appears
8. Set due date and time
9. Save - item is now a Reminder

### Visual Design
- **Reminder**: Blue gradient (from-blue-500 to-blue-600)
- **Event**: Green/Teal gradient (from-emerald-500 to-teal-600)
- **Note**: Orange gradient (from-amber-500 to-orange-500) ✨

## Database Migration
All existing reminders without a `due_at` date have been automatically converted to Notes.

To manually run the conversion again (if needed):
```sql
UPDATE items 
SET type = 'note'
WHERE type = 'reminder' 
AND id IN (
  SELECT item_id 
  FROM reminder_details 
  WHERE due_at IS NULL
);
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/types/index.ts` - Added "note" to ItemType
2. `src/components/EditFormNew.tsx` - Added Note type support in form
3. `src/components/NotesView.tsx` - Updated filtering logic
4. `src/components/ViewDetails.tsx` - Added "When is it due?" conversion
5. `src/components/ItemCard.tsx` - Added Note icon and styling
6. `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated note counting
7. `supabase/migrations/20251101120000_add_note_type.sql` - Database enum update
8. `supabase/migrations/20251101120001_convert_reminders_to_notes.sql` - Data migration

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Create a new Note (orange type selection works)
- [x] Note shows in Notes view
- [x] Note displays with StickyNote icon
- [x] View Note details

- [x] No TypeScript errors

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add keyboard shortcut for quick note creation (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl + N)
2. Add "Convert to Reminder" quick action on Note cards
3. Add bulk conversion tool in settings
4. Add Note-specific sorting options in Notes view
5. Consider adding a "Recently created" section for Notes

## Notes on Implementation
- Notes don't have `reminder_details` or `event_details` - they're just basic items
- Status is always "pending" for Notes (completed notes are filtered to "current week" in NotesView)
- No subtasks for Notes (feature is hidden in form)
- Smart parser doesn't auto-detect Notes (users explicitly select the type)
- The system maintains backward compatibility - existing reminders continue to work
